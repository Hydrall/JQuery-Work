# JQuery-Work
Some example JQuery projects I've done.

A JQuery program created to pull, organize, and display results from the ProPublica bill database for a customer site. It contacts the API, pulls the data, and uses JQuery to dynamically sort and paginate it.

This program gradually grew into the APIRenderer module in another repository of mine, after it became clear that this method of doing things had a performance impact.
